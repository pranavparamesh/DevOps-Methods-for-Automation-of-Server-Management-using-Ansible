Actually i was using Ansible to install Apache2 at so many system from server computer at a time so Infrastructure design is a software life cycle step that defines and tailors software infrastructure requirements, including the number and form of material managers or required hardware. Infrastructure construction often requires a large amount of installation and maintenance documentation required to do things like:
 (i) strengthening and connecting the equipment needed (either physical or physical) for the software to work,
 (ii) installing and repairing the required software and purchases within the virtual machine,
 (iii) to strengthen and run the support resources needed for the software to be used.
